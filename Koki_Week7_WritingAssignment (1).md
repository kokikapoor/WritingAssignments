*Prompt: How do businesses with primarily open-source codebases make money?   
&nbsp;

> Though it may sound counter-intuitive, there are multiple open-source companies that make around $100 million dollars in revenue annually--RedHat, WordPress, Confluent, etc. There are some Pre-Requisites and subsequent economic models to follow in order to gain this kind of success in the open-source field. Making money in open-source is oftentimes correlated with providing open-source that can be “broadly adopted.” In simpler terms, this means that code that has many uses and can be applied to varied and different systems, libraries will naturally be used by a wider range of programmers and coders from different sectors of the technology world. This almost universal usability of code that leads to a greater rate of adoption of the code signifies greater economic yield for open-source codebases and companies. Additionally, in order to achieve this yield, the company also needs to be established as the lead and most credible provided of open-source code in that sector. Hence there is a line that has to be created between providing universally applicable code and yet keeping it unique. Companies such as Elastic and MongoDB have succeeded at this. There are several other business models that enable profits for open-source codebases—support, hosting, restrictive licensing, open core, and hybrid licensing. The “Support” model loses its worth over time as it is catered to production-oriented services that may require a lot of manual work. The “Hosting” model is used for code that is used as a “Cloud” or hosting software and hence is one of the most popularly used models in open-source software. Economic yield is achieved using the “Restrictive Licensing” model as it relies on legal regulations/law for monetary gain from users. The “Open-Core” model allows users of the open-source codebase to a high percentage/majority of the code but makes the rest proprietary or accessible only behind a paywall. Hybrid Licensing is the newest model and combines open-source code with proprietary code into the same repository.
