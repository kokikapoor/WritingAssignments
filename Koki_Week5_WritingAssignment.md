*Prompt: What are open source licenses and why should you care? (Hint: you should probably care ) How should you choose one?   
&nbsp;

> Open-Source licenses are licenses that allow creators and organizations to ethically and legally solicit Open-Source Software that will help with the simple, often mundane aspects of their code and give them the time to focus on other aspects of their creative development process. These licenses are created in line with the **“Open-Source Definition”** that is based on the principles and policies of **“free distribution, source code, derived works, integrity of the author’s code, no discrimination against persons or groups, no discrimination against fields of endeavor, distribution of licence, license must not be specific to a product, license must not restrict other software, and license should be technologically-neutral,”** that were put together by the *Open Source Initiative*. There are several different kinds of licenses that can be used such as **MIT, Apache-2.0, GPL-2.0, ISC, GPL-3.0, BSD-3-Clause, LGPL-3.0, The Unlicense, BSD-2-Clause** that have unique sets of benefits. For people who want a simple, uncomplicated, and relatively open license, the MIT License which is also implemented in **.NET Core and Rails** are a good bet. For those that want the freedom to contribute to other’s code in any capacity and vice-versa, the GNU General Public License v3 that is also used in **Ansible and Bas**h is perfect. For people that are fully invested in copyright-free initiatives without the bounds of licenses, etc. the public-domain field might be one to look into.

> When it comes to what licenses to create/choose, organizations have to be careful and calculated about the Open-Source Code that they license. While the urge to heavily depend on Open Source Software (OSS) is high, it can also compromise the uniqueness and creativity of the product in development. In fact there have been instances in the past, where this has been an issue specifically in large corporations such as **Tesla** and **Samsung**.
