*Prompt: How do you create and maintain a community of open source contributors? What should you add to your open-source library (including, at least, a well-written readme file: what should go into it?) to make it welcoming and inclusive?  
&nbsp;

> I would argue that what makes an open-source codebases or project successful, is the contributions that it brings in. Contributors help to improve code, software, find issues, provide an outside perspective and most importantly, build a community of eager and excited coders, often-times even sparking mentor-mentee relationships. To foster this kind of welcoming and inclusive community in an Open-Source codebase, there are many steps that can be taken. A friendly README.md file is the first thing you can create to help outside coders understand your project, its process, and how to get started. Technically, a README.md file should be the first file you create in your repository and it should be placed in the highest level of the directory. There are many websites that even provide templates that can be used as a baseline to create an appropriate, accurate, welcoming, and useful README Markdown file. 
Other useful files to include in your project are a *Contributors/Record of Changes* file that keeps track of commits and the people that submitted these pull requests. An *Ideas/Suggestions* Markdown file could also be useful for people who have ideas for your project that they donâ€™t know how to implement, or for them to provide experimental code that they are uncertain about. When it comes to the program and class code itself, using self-explanatory variable names where possible, adding succinct yet informative comments for functions and methods, being organized and uniform in your formatting, and refraining from potentially offensive comments/hate-speech are the bare minimum to creating a safe space for all contributors. My friend Sima recently told me that there is also a specific font that can be incorporated into Open Source code that makes the code more readable and accessible to people who suffer from dyslexia and other reading disabilities.
